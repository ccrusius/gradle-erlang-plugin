This Gradle plugin provides basic Erlang building functionality for
Gradle. It can not replace `rebar` yet (and maybe it will never be
able to), but it is good enough for compiling OTP applications, and
generating `reltool` releases. It also supports "module renaming,"
something `rebar` does not. One plugin usage example is the
[gen_c_server](https://github.com/ccrusius/gen_c_server) project,
which uses this to build both Erlang and C sources, and test the
packages using Erlang's
[Common Test](http://erlang.org/doc/man/ct.html) framework.

The main reason behind this plugin is the need to incorporate Erlang
into multi-language build environments: while `rebar` does its job
well with Erlang, as soon as you get out of it you start running into
trouble. Native binaries from C/C++, for example, are hard to pull
off. The choices are: either one waits for `rebar` to add support for
all other languages (Java, C/C++, etc) in all platforms (Windows,
Unix, Mac, etc); or one adds Erlang support to a build system that
already has all the other things taken care of. The second option is
obviously the correct one.

The next decision is to which build system to add Erlang support to,
and there are not many around that can cover all the cases. Google's
Bazel does not have proper Windows support. CMake supports C well,
but everything else is clunky. At the end of the day, Gradle is the
one that ticks most boxes, and that's the one I went with.

# Basic Use

1. Install this plugin,
2. Configure path to Erlang installation (if needed),
3. `gradle ebuild`, or `gradle reltool`, etc.

# Specifying which Erlang to Use

The Erlang installation to be used is given by the `installation`
property of the `erlang` extension. The default uses whatever you have
on your `$PATH`. If you need to specify the path to an installation,
you need to set the `erlangRoot` project property before applying the
plugin. Example:
```groovy
plugins {
  id 'org.ccrusius.erlang' apply false
}

ext {
  erlangRoot = '/opt/erlang/r16b03-1'
}

apply plugin: 'org.ccrusius.erlang'
```

# Compiling and Installing OTP Applications

When the plugin is applied, it will create an `ebuild` task that
builds the OTP application in the current directory and the ones found
in sub-projects. The Erlang plugin will consider that an application
needs to be built when it finds an `.app` file in
`$projectDir/ebin`. It will compile the application based on
the sources in `$projectDir/src`. Individual tasks for the application's `.beam`
files will also be created.

In the app file, any occurrences of the `gradle_project_version` atom will
be replaced by the value of `project.version`
(which is filled in, for example, by the
[git versioning plugin](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.zoltu.git-versioning)),
or, if that doesn't exist, by `project.ext.version`.

For each application, the plugin will create a
`installNameApplication` task, where `Name` is the application name
capitalized. This task will install the application in an
appropriately named directory inside
`${project.buildDir}/install/erlang-lib`.

# Producing Releases with Reltool

If there is a reltool `.config` file in the project root directory,
the plugin will create a `reltool` task that will generate a release
based on that configuration file.

# Evaluating Erlang Code

You can get the output of an arbitrary Erlang expression evaluation by
using the `eval` function:
```groovy
def two = erlang.eval('io:format("~w",[1+1]).')
```
The `erlang.eval` function is just a shortcut for
`erlang.installation.escript.eval`.

# Compiling Erlang Code

The plugin provides a `Compile` task with a few parameters, settable via
the following functions:

* `setSourceFile`: Specifies the path to the Erlang source file to be
  compiled.
* `setOutputDir`: Specifies the folder where the compiled file should
  be placed. The name of the file will be the same as that of the
  source file, with the appropriate extension. The default is to place
  it in the same directory as the source file.
* `setArguments`: Specifies extra arguments to pass to the Erlang
  compiler.

Example:
```groovy
task hello_world_beam(type: org.ccrusius.erlang.tasks.Compile) {
  setSourceFile 'src/hello_world.erl'
  setOutputDir 'ebin'
  setArguments '-DMY_MACRO'
}
```

Normally one will not have to use this task, unless Erlang is being
compiled outside of an OTP application structure.

## Advanced: Manipulating the Source File Before Compiling

Suppose you want to compile an application, which includes some other
applications or modules. Unfortunately, the versions for those extra
modules conflict with what is included by other applications. What do
you do?

The standard Erlang answer to this is "rename the dependencies to
something that does not clash with anything else." This is hackish, to
say the least, but it is the only solution. This Gradle plugin allows
you to incorporate that hack into the build system with the following
compilation properties:

* `setNewName`: Specify a new name for the source file. The original
  source file will be copied to a file with the given name, in the
  same directory. After compilation, whether things succeed or not,
  the new file will be removed.
* `addReplacement`: This takes in two strings, a regular expression
  and a replacement string. Those will be applied to the new file.

An example should clarify things. Suppose you have the following
module in a file called `src/my_module.erl`:
```erlang
-module(my_module).
-export([my_function/0]).

my_function() -> 1.
```
Suppose you want to rename the module to `new_module`, and the
function to `new_function`. This Gradle snippet does it:
```groovy
task new_module(type: org.ccrusius.gradle.tasks.Compile) {
  setSourceFile 'src/my_module.erl'
  setNewName 'new_module.erl'
  addReplacement 'my_module', 'new_module'
  addReplacement 'my_function', 'new_function'
}
```
The task will now write a `src/new_module.erl` file with the contents
```erlang
-module(new_module).
-export([new_function/0]).

new_function() -> 1.
```
and compile it. Hackish module rename accomplished.
